# Project Title

LoginLoom: Seamless Authentication with React and NodeJS

## Description

This project is a  login system built using React for the frontend, NodeJS for the backend, and Bootstrap for styling. It provides a robust authentication mechanism for user login and stores user details securely.

## Motivation/Goal

The goal of this project is to showcase the implementation of a secure authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for both the client and server sides. The project emphasizes the importance of token-based authentication, ensuring a robust and stateless communication between the React frontend and NodeJS backend. Additionally, the inclusion of refresh tokens enhances the security and user experience by providing seamless token renewal without requiring frequent logins.

By building this authentication system, developers can learn:

- How to integrate JWT for secure user authentication in React applications.
- Implementation of a NodeJS backend that generates and verifies JWT tokens.
- The significance of refresh tokens and their role in maintaining user sessions.
- Best practices for securing web applications against common vulnerabilities.
- Integration of Bootstrap for a clean and responsive user interface.
  
Furthermore, the project demonstrates the implementation of the following features:

- **React States:** Utilize React states to manage the application's dynamic content, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Bootstrap Table:** Integrate a Bootstrap table to display user details, enhancing the overall visual appeal and organization of user information.
- **Modal Component:** Implement a modal component to handle user interactions such as registration
- **Delete Functionality:** Add a delete function within the Bootstrap table to allow users to remove their details. This feature enhances the user's control over their information and contributes to a more user-friendly application.

This comprehensive project aims to serve as a practical guide for developers seeking to implement a secure, token-based authentication system with enhanced user interface features in their React applications. The use of JWT, refresh tokens, React states, and Bootstrap components collectively provides a foundation for building modern and secure web applications and also provide more user-friendly experience for both developers and end-users.
 

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to quickly set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-node-bootstrap-login.git
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
   cd react-node-bootstrap-login  and  cd backend

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
  npm install


4. Run Frontend/Vite:
  npm run dev


5. Start the backend server:
  node server.js
##Note: This will require and mongodb database i did not provide mine due to security purpose so for that you will require either local mongodb in your system like mongodb compass or online(atlas) mongodb. for setup a database schema
##the schema is given inside the model you can read it and create it accordingly also add database name infront of ? of mongo url it will connect automaticatically


6. Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app in action.
